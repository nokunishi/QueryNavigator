This is the youtube video link for our frontend demo.

**NOTE**: After recording we noticed that we did not show some network requests after sending a request. Some of them were hard to find in network tab because of different libraries sending requests and cluttering the network tab.


For the last query, at 5:54, there is a log named "query" with "POST" and status code 200 at the very bottom of the log stack, indicating that our query was successful. As mentioned in the video, for some of the failing cases are handled at the UI level, not at the server level. Thus, there will be no logs for those DoDs.
